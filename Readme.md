# ASP.NET Core and Vue CLI templates

This repo contains the code for the article _ASP.NET Core Vue CLI templates_ published in the [DotNetCurry](https://www.dotnetcurry.com/author/daniel-jimenez-garcia) magazine.

It contains 3 different ways to integrate an ASP.NET Core project with a project generated by the Vue CLI

- **separated-projects**. Keeps each clearly separated, developed and debugged separately. Simplest approach but lets you play to the strengths of each side and use specialzed tooling for each
- **adapted-spa-template**. Adapts the official React SPA template and [its SPA middleware](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/tree/master/src/Middleware/SpaServices.Extensions/src/ReactDevelopmentServer) to start the Vue development server and proxy requests to it. Very similar to the template published by [Software Ateliers](https://github.com/SoftwareAteliers/asp-net-core-vue-starter).
- **alternative-spa-template**. Variant of the earlier template where the Vue development server is the one proxying requests to the ASP.NET Core server. Slightly better hot reload performance apart from solving the [errors seen](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/7812) with the hot reload web sockets
